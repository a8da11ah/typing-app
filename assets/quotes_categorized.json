    "I hope the fans have enjoyed listening as much as I've enjoyed doing the games. I don't ever go to the park where I don't have a good day. I don't like losing. But I don't think I ever go to the park where I have a bad day. I don't think once. by Bob Uecker",
    "After spending 460 days as a hostage, I did emerge a fundamentally changed person.
